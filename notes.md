## Notes
* Use heap (priority queue) while sorting array to store the largest element.
* Memoization: storing processed values in array and using them so they do not have to be recalculated.
* Dynamic programming: Divide and conquer (break into subproblems) and memoization.
* Probability: number of events / number of possible outcomes
* Likelihood(odds): probability that event happens / probability that event doesn't happen
* Abstract data type is an interface of a datatype. It is the set of operations that can be performed on the data but the actual operations are abstracted/hidden.
